\begin{itemize}
  \item Quad tree rebuilt from scratch at each time step
  \item Quad tree could be built in parallel: efficient if bodies are sorted
  \item Spatial distribution of body assignment (load balancing) could be improved
  \item[] 
  \item A smart serial algorithm is \textbf{much} faster than a parallelized trivial approach
  \item Upper bound of speedups can easily be reached, hence controlling serial and communcation times is critical
\end{itemize}
